- 2.0.0-rc.1:
    - Added: random.is_state_invalidated to check if a PRNGKey was invalidated.
    - Changed: random.split now can perform nested splits only up to a limit and returns
        an invalidated state if this limit is exceeded. This is to guarantee
        unique states after each split derived from the same inital randomness state.
    - Changed: random.random_bits now returns an additional error flag integer,
        which is set if the input randomness state was invalidated or the
        randomness counter overflows.
    - Changed: random.uniform now returns all NaNs if the input randomness state
        was invalidated or the randomness counter overflows.
    - Removed: random.fold_in.
- 1.2.0:
    - Deprecated: random.fold_in.
- 1.1.1:
    - Added: support for jax up to v0.3.13.
- 1.1.0:
    - Added: support for multiple layers of vmap wraps for functions in chacha.random.
    - Added: support for jax up to v0.3.1.
- 1.0.0:
    - Added: Native implementations for ChaCha block function as JAX ops.
    - Added: chacha.native.cuda_supported, returns True if cuda kernels were compiled.
    - Added: wheels for Python 3.10.
    - Added: support for jax up to v0.2.27.
    - Removed: support for jax v0.2.10 - v0.2.11.
- 0.1.0-alpha.2:
    - Fix: random.random_bits() no longer fails for empty shape.
