# Bernstein's ChaCha Reference Implementation

This directory contains the reference implementation of ChaCha by its creator, Daniel J. Bernstein.

The source code of ChaCha is available from [his website](http://cr.yp.to/chacha.html#chacha-paper)
but requires additional header files from the [ECRYPT NoE Stream Cipher Project Portable C](https://www.ecrypt.eu.org/stream/call/PortableC.html).
As there is no license permitting their direct inclusion, these must be downloaded via the `download_estream_headers.sh` file.

## License
Bernstein put the reference implementation of ChaCha into the public domain.
